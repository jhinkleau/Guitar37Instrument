/******************************************************************************
 * Name:
 * 
 * Description: Plays guitar strings when the user presses certain keys on the
 * keyboard. Karplus-Strong algorithm is used to synthesize the sound of a
 * plucked string.
 * 
 * In the constructor of the class implementing Instrument, you will initialize
 * Concert A frequency as 440. Based on that, you will create "Guitar 37"
 * strings, every frequency of which will be defined as:
 * 
 * frequency = CONCERT_A * Math.pow(2.0, (i - 24) / 12.0)
 * 
 * where i is within [0, 37) range. For every one of 37 strings, you will
 * allocate a "buffer" (LinkedList<Double>) the size of which is defined as:
 * 
 * size = 44100 / frequency
 * 
 * For example, the first 6 strings could have the following sizes:
 * 400, 378, 357, 337, 318, 300
 * 
 * The constructor will initialize all buffers of all strings with zeros.
